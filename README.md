# WebScraping_Project
In this assignment, I'll be diving into the practical application of Python programming to create a web scraping project. Web scraping, a technique used to extract valuable information from websites, is a key skill in the realm of data collection and analysis.

The purpose of this application is to display a welcome message and a main menu, offering five options:

#### 1- Display Latest Deals: View the most recent deals scraped from the designated website, including essential details such as store name, item description, and more.
#### 2- Analyze Deals by Category: Get insights into the dataset's categorical distribution by viewing a comprehensive list of available categories and the corresponding number of deals within     each.
#### 3- Find Top Stores: Identify and display top stores based on the number of associated deals, allowing for personalized exploration of popular sources.
#### 4- Log Deal Information: Log all deal links within a selected category to a file named 'log.txt', facilitating the organization and storage of deal information.
#### 5- Exit: Gracefully exit the application, ensuring proper release of all resources.

This project leverages the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries for efficient web scraping in Python. The requests library is employed to send HTTP requests and retrieve HTML content from the specified website, while BeautifulSoup facilitates the parsing and extraction of relevant information from the HTML structure.
